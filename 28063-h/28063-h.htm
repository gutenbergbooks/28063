<h1><i>THE<br />
NEXT LOGICAL STEP</i></h1>

<div class="bk1"><span class="sp2">Ordinarily the military least wants to have the others</span><br />

<span class="sp1">But, logically, there would be times&mdash;</span>

<h2><i>BY BEN BOVA</i></h2></div>

<p>&#9632;&nbsp;"I don't really see where this problem
has anything to do with me," the
CIA man said. "And, frankly, there
are a lot of more important things I
could be doing."</p>

<p>Ford, the physicist, glanced at
General LeRoy. The general had
that quizzical expression on his face,
the look that meant he was about to
do something decisive.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the problem
first-hand?" the general asked,
innocently.</p>

<p>The CIA man took a quick look at
his wristwatch. "O.K., if it doesn't
take too long. It's late enough already."</p>

<p>"It won't take very long, will it,
Ford?" the general said, getting out
of his chair.</p>

<p>"Not very long," Ford agreed.
"Only a lifetime."</p>

<p>The CIA man grunted as they
went to the doorway and left the
general's office. Going down the
dark, deserted hallway, their footsteps
echoed hollowly.</p>

<p>"I can't overemphasize the seriousness
of the problem," General
LeRoy said to the CIA man. "Eight
ranking members of the General
Staff have either resigned their commissions
or gone straight to the violent
ward after just one session with
the computer."</p>

<p>The CIA man scowled. "Is this
area Secure?"</p>

<p>General LeRoy's face turned red.
"This entire building is as Secure as
any edifice in the Free World, mister.
And it's empty. We're the only
living people inside here at this hour.
I'm not taking any chances."</p>

<p>"Just want to be sure."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I explain the computer
a little more," Ford said, changing
the subject, "you'll know what to
expect."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said the man from
CIA.</p>

<p>"We told you that this is the most
modern, most complex and delicate
computer in the world ... nothing
like it has ever been attempted before&mdash;anywhere."</p>

<p>"I know that They don't have anything
like it," the CIA man agreed.</p>

<p>"And you also know, I suppose,
that it was built to simulate actual
war situations. We fight wars in this
computer ... wars with missiles and
bombs and gas. Real wars, complete
down to the tiniest detail. The computer
tells us what will actually happen
to every missile, every city, every
man ... who dies, how many planes
are lost, how many trucks will fail to
start on a cold morning, whether a
battle is won or lost ..."</p>

<p>General LeRoy interrupted. "The
computer runs these analyses for
both sides, so we can see what's happening
to Them, too."</p>

<p>The CIA man gestured impatiently.
"War games simulations aren't
new. You've been doing them for
years."</p>

<p>"Yes, but this machine is different,"
Ford pointed out. "It not only
gives a much more detailed war
game. It's the next logical step in the
development of machine-simulated
war games." He hesitated dramatically.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"We've added a variation of the
electro-encephalograph ..."</p>

<p>The CIA man stopped walking.
"The electro-what?"</p>

<p>"Electro-encephalograph. You
know, a recording device that reads
the electrical patterns of your brain.
Like the electro-cardiograph."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"But you see, we've given the
EEG a reverse twist. Instead of using
a machine that makes a recording of
the brain's electrical wave output,
we've developed a device that will
take the computer's readout tapes,
and turn them into electrical patterns
that are put <i>into</i> your brain!"</p>

<p>"I don't get it."</p>

<p>General LeRoy took over. "You
sit at the machine's control console.
A helmet is placed over your head.
You set the machine in operation.
You <i>see</i> the results."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ford went on. "Instead of
reading rows of figures from the computer's
printer ... you actually see
the war being fought. Complete visual
and auditory hallucinations. You
can watch the progress of the battles,
and as you change strategy and tactics
you can see the results before
your eyes."</p>

<p>"The idea, originally, was to make
it easier for the General Staff to visualize
strategic situations," General
LeRoy said.</p>

<p>"But every one who's used the machine
has either resigned his commission
or gone insane," Ford added.</p>

<p>The CIA man cocked an eye at
LeRoy. "You've used the computer."</p>

<p>"Correct."</p>

<p>"And you have neither resigned
nor cracked up."</p>

<p>General LeRoy nodded. "I called
you in."</p>

<p>Before the CIA man could comment,
Ford said, "The computer's
right inside this doorway. Let's get
this over with while the building is
still empty."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">They stepped in. The physicist
and the general showed the CIA
man through the room-filling rows of
massive consoles.</p>

<p>"It's all transistorized and subminiaturized,
of course," Ford explained.
"That's the only way we
could build so much detail into the
machine and still have it small
enough to fit inside a single building."</p>

<p>"A single building?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; this is only the control
section. Most of this building is taken
up by the circuits, the memory banks,
and the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m."</p>

<div class="figright"><b><small>ILLUSTRATED BY SCHELLING</small></b>
<img src="images/002.png" width="362" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>They showed him finally to a
small desk, studded with control
buttons and dials. The single spotlight
above the desk lit it brilliantly,
in harsh contrast to the semidarkness
of the rest of the room.</p>

<p>"Since you've never run the computer
before," Ford said, "General
LeRoy will do the controlling. You
just sit and watch what happens."</p>

<p>The general sat in one of the well-padded
chairs and donned a grotesque
headgear that was connected
to the desk by a half-dozen wires.
The CIA man took his chair slowly.</p>

<p>When they put one of the bulky
helmets on him, he looked up at
them, squinting a little in the bright
light. "This ... this isn't going to ...
well, do me any damage, is it?"</p>

<p>"My goodness, no," Ford said.
"You mean mentally? No, of course
not. You're not on the General Staff,
so it shouldn't ... it won't ... affect
you the way it did the others. Their
reaction had nothing to do with the
computer <i>per se</i> ..."</p>

<p>"Several civilians have used the
computer with no ill effects," General
LeRoy said. "Ford has used it many
times."</p>

<p>The CIA man nodded, and they
closed the transparent visor over his
face. He sat there and watched General
LeRoy press a series of buttons,
then turn a dial.</p>

<p>"Can you hear me?" The general's
voice came muffled through the helmet.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"All right. Here we go. You're familiar
with Situation One-Two-One?
That's what we're going to be seeing."</p>

<p>Situation One-Two-One was a
standard war game. The CIA man
was well acquainted with it. He
watched the general flip a switch,
then sit back and fold his arms over
his chest. A row of lights on the desk
console began blinking on and off,
one, two, three ... down to the end
of the row, then back to the beginning
again, on and off, on and off ...</p>

<p>And then, somehow, he could see
it!</p>

<p>He was poised incredibly somewhere
in space, and he could see it
all in a funny, blurry-double-sighted,
dream-like way. He seemed to be
seeing several pictures and hearing
many voices, all at once. It was all
mixed up, and yet it made a weird
kind of sense.</p>

<p>For a panicked instant he wanted
to rip the helmet off his head. <i>It's
only an illusion</i>, he told himself,
forcing calm on his unwilling nerves.
<i>Only an illusion.</i></p>

<p>But it seemed strangely real.</p>

<p>He was watching the Gulf of Mexico.
He could see Florida off to his
right, and the arching coast of the
southeastern United States. He could
even make out the Rio Grande River.</p>

<p>Situation One-Two-One started,
he remembered, with the discovery
of missile-bearing Enemy submarines
in the Gulf. Even as he watched the
whole area&mdash;as though perched on a
satellite&mdash;he could see, underwater
and close-up, the menacing shadowy
figure of a submarine gliding
through the crystal blue sea.</p>

<p>He saw, too, a patrol plane as it
spotted the submarine and sent an
urgent radio warning.</p>

<p>The underwater picture dissolved
in a bewildering burst of bubbles. A
missile had been launched. Within
seconds, another burst&mdash;this time a
nuclear depth charge&mdash;utterly destroyed
the submarine.</p>

<p>It was confusing. He was everyplace
at once. The details were overpowering,
but the total picture was
agonizingly clear.</p>

<p>Six submarines fired missiles from
the Gulf of Mexico. Four were immediately
sunk, but too late. New
Orleans, St. Louis and three Air
Force bases were obliterated by
hydrogen-fusion warheads.</p>

<p>The CIA man was familiar with
the opening stages of the war. The
first missile fired at the United States
was the signal for whole fleets of missiles
and bombers to launch themselves
at the Enemy. It was confusing
to see the world at once; at times he
could not tell if the fireball and mushroom
cloud was over Chicago or
Shanghai, New York or Novosibirsk,
Baltimore or Budapest.</p>

<p>It did not make much difference,
really. They all got it in the first few
hours of the war; as did London and
Moscow, Washington and Peking,
Detroit and Delhi, and many, many
more.</p>

<p>The defensive systems on all sides
seemed to operate well, except that
there were never enough anti-missiles.
Defensive systems were expensive
compared to attack rockets. It
was cheaper to build a deterrent than
to defend against it.</p>

<p>The missiles flashed up from submarines
and railway cars, from underground
silos and stratospheric
jets; secret ones fired off automatically
when a certain airbase command
post ceased beaming out a restraining
radio signal. The defensive systems
were simply overloaded. And
when the bombs ran out, the missiles
carried dust and germs and gas.
On and on. For six days and six firelit
nights. Launch, boost, coast, re-enter,
death.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">And now it was over, the CIA man
thought. The missiles were all gone.
The airplanes were exhausted. The
nations that had built the weapons
no longer existed. By all the rules he
knew of, the war should have been
ended.</p>

<p>Yet the fighting did not end. The
machine knew better. There were
still many ways to kill an enemy.
Time-tested ways. There were armies
fighting in four continents, armies
that had marched overland, or
splashed ashore from the sea, or
dropped out of the skies.</p>

<p>Incredibly, the war went on.
When the tanks ran out of gas, and
the flame throwers became useless,
and even the prosaic artillery pieces
had no more rounds to fire, there
were still simple guns and even simpler
bayonets and swords.</p>

<p>The proud armies, the descendents
of the Alexanders and Caesars and
Temujins and Wellingtons and
Grants and Rommels, relived their
evolution in reverse.</p>

<p>The war went on. Slowly, inevitably,
the armies split apart into
smaller and smaller units, until the
tortured countryside that so recently
had felt the impact of nuclear war
once again knew the tread of bands
of armed marauders. The tiny savage
groups, stranded in alien lands, far
from the homes and families that
they knew to be destroyed, carried
on a mockery of war, lived off the
land, fought their own countrymen if
the occasion suited, and revived the
ancient terror of hand-wielded, personal,
one-head-at-a-time killing.</p>

<p>The CIA man watched the world
disintegrate. Death was an individual
business now, and none the better
for no longer being mass-produced.
In agonized fascination he
saw the myriad ways in which a
man might die. Murder was only one
of them. Radiation, disease, toxic
gases that lingered and drifted on
the once-innocent winds, and&mdash;finally&mdash;the
most efficient destroyer of them
all: starvation.</p>

<p>Three billion people (give or take
a meaningless hundred million)
lived on the planet Earth when the
war began. Now, with the tenuous
thread of civilization burned away,
most of those who were not killed by
the fighting itself succumbed inexorably
to starvation.</p>

<p>Not everyone died, of course. Life
went on. Some were lucky.</p>

<p>A long darkness settled on the
world. Life went on for a few, a pitiful
few, a bitter, hateful, suspicious,
savage few. Cities became pestholes.
Books became fuel. Knowledge died.
Civilization was completely gone
from the planet Earth.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">The helmet was lifted slowly off
his head. The CIA man found that
he was too weak to raise his arms
and help. He was shivering and
damp with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Now you see," Ford said quietly,
"why the military men cracked up
when they used the computer."</p>

<p>General LeRoy, even, was pale.
"How can a man with any conscience
at all direct a military operation
when he knows that <i>that</i> will be the
consequence?"</p>

<p>The CIA man struck up a cigarette
and pulled hard on it. He exhaled
sharply. "Are all the war games ...
like that? Every plan?"</p>

<p>"Some are worse," Ford said. "We
picked an average one for you. Even
some of the 'brushfire' games get out
of hand and end up like that."</p>

<p>"So ... what do you intend to do?
Why did you call me in? What can
<i>I</i> do?"</p>

<p>"You're with CIA," the general
said. "Don't you handle espionage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what's that got to do
with it?"</p>

<p>The general looked at him. "It
seems to me that the next logical
step is to make damned certain that
<i>They</i> get the plans to this computer
... and fast!"&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
